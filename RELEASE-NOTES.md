Lettuce 6.0.0 RC2 RELEASE NOTES
==============================

The Lettuce team is delighted to announce the availability of the second and final Lettuce 6 release candidate.

Most notable changes that ship with this release are

* Kotlin Coroutine API
* Redesign command latency metrics publishing

We're working now towards the final release of Lettuce 6.0 by incorporating feedback from this release candidate.

Kotlin Coroutine API
--------------------

Kotlin users can now use a Coroutine API that exposes suspended methods and uses `Flow` where appropriate.
The API can be obtained through an extension function for Standalone, Cluster, and Sentinel connections exposing the appropriate API.  

```kotlin
val suspendableCommands: RedisSuspendableCommands<String, String> = connection.suspendable()

val foo1 = suspendableCommands.set("foo", "bar")
val foo2 = suspendableCommands.keys("fo*")
```

Additionally, we ship two extensions that simplify transactional usage by providing a `multi` closure:

```kotlin
val result: TransactionResult = connection.async().multi {
    set("foo", "bar")
    get("foo")
}
```

The API is marked experimental and requires opt-in through `@ExperimentalLettuceCoroutinesApi` to avoid Compiler warnings. 
We expect further evolution of the API towards a more `Flow`-oriented API where now `List` is returned to enable streaming of large responses.

Redesign command latency metrics publishing
-------------------------------------------

This is a mostly internal change that switches from `CommandLatencyCollector` to the newly introduced `CommandLatencyRecorder` interface. 
Unless you're implementing or configuring `CommandLatencyCollector` yourself, you should not see any changes.

This change is motivated by support for libraries that provide latency observability without publishing metrics to the `EventBus`.

Thanks to all contributors who made Lettuce 6.0.0.RC2 possible.
Lettuce requires a minimum of Java 8 to build and run and is compatible with Java 15. It is tested continuously against the latest Redis source-build.
